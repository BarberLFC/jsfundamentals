    //There are four logical operators in JavaScript:
    // || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT), ?? (Nullish Coalescing)

    //OR ||
    alert( true || true );   // true
    alert( false || true );  // true
    alert( true || false );  // true
    alert( false || false ); // false

    //result is always true except for the case when both operands are false.

    //Most of the time, OR || is used in an if statement to
    // test if any of the given conditions is true

    let hour = 9;
    if (hour <10 || hour >18) {
        alert( 'The office is closed');
    }

    //more conditions
    let hours = 12;
    let isWeekend = true;
    if (hours <10 || hours >18 ||isWeekend) {
        alert( 'The office is closed'); // it is the weekend
    }

    //multiple OR'ed values
        //Evaluates operands from left to right.
        //For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is true, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
        //If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were false), returns the last operand.
        //In other words, a chain of OR || returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found.

    alert( 1 || 0 ); // 1 (1 is truthy)

    alert( null || 1 ); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)
    alert( null || 0 || 1 ); // 1 (the first truthy value)

    alert( undefined || null || 0 ); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)

    //Getting the first truthy value from a list of variables or expressions

    let firstName = "";
    let lastName = "";
    let nickName = "SuperCoder";

    alert( firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous"); // SuperCoder

    //Short-circuit evaluation
        //It means that || processes its arguments until the first truthy value is
        //reached, and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching
        //the other argument.

        //the example below result is "printed"
        true || alert("not printed");
        false || alert("printed");
        //In the first line, the OR || operator stops the evaluation immediately
        //upon seeing true, so the alert isnâ€™t run.

    //AND &&
